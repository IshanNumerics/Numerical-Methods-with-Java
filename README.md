This is a small project I did in Summer of 2017 to learn the basics of Java programming language. 

The focus here is again on basic numerical methods that I randomly picked from a numerical methods book.The most challenging one however was the Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) method. 
Coincidentally, at the time I did this project I was doing my master's thesis in aeroacoustics where I had for the first time encountered the practical usage of 
frequency domain plots. This little excercise of coding the DFT helped me understand the basic idea behind it.


At that particular moment I did not have a GitHub account. Now I have made it and will move all the files here.
